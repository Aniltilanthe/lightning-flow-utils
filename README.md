This repo contains a collection of reusable flow utils that can be used to enhance Lightning Flow from Salesforce. 

# Invocable Apex
Can be added to both to both screen flows and auto-launched flows as actions, and execute entirely in the Salesforce cloud.

## 1. Convert Records to CSV

### Summary
This action takes a list of sObject records, generates a CSV report and uploads to Salesforce files. By default, the file will associate to the running user. 

### Features
- Specify a string or text collection of record IDs to associate the file to. Each ID will create a single ContentDocumentLink
- Specify the sharing and visibility of each ContentDocumentLink
- Customize the order and fields included in your CSV via text collection or comma-seperated string. This is optional, if left blank, it will export all fields that were in the collection
- Can execute 'asynchronously' if CPU timing is an issue. 
- If run asynchronously, supports generating a platform event of type 'CSV_Document__e'. The platform event does not come packaged with this, you will need to create it manually for now.
