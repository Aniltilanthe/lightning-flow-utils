This repo contains a collection of reusable flow utils that can be used to enhance Lightning Flow from Salesforce. 

# Invocable Apex
Can be added to both to both screen flows and auto-launched flows as actions, and execute entirely in the Salesforce cloud.

## Convert Records to CSV

This action takes a list of sObject records and generates a CSV report that is uploaded to your Salesforce files. CSV columns (sObject fields) are customizable as well as document information. If the action is executed asynchronously (indicated via parameter) the job id(s) for the execution are returned imediately and document information is published via platform event. Otherwise CSV document information is returned immediately. 

Go to [x: TODO] to read more or to download and install the package.
